# WorkChat
Here I took it upon myself to develop a chat application for work places. Rather than emails etc, this work chat would serve as an efficient alternative. I decided to create it alongside a website I created a while back which is being revamped. Using Visual Studio I had a few challenges, however as I loved the process, I got to the end.
